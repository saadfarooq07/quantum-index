# Ethical AI Guidelines for Q0rtex

## Purpose
These guidelines ensure responsible and ethical use of quantum-inspired AI techniques in terminal environments.

## Core Principles

1. **Transparency**
- All AI-enhanced suggestions must be clearly marked
- Users should be informed about quantum-inspired processing
- Processing methods should be documentable and auditable

2. **Privacy**
- Command history is processed locally using Metal acceleration
- No user data is transmitted without explicit consent
- Quantum state information is ephemeral and secured

3. **Fairness**
- Suggestions are generated without bias
- Equal processing priority for all users
- No discrimination in command completion

4. **Resource Efficiency**
- Optimal use of Metal acceleration
- Energy-efficient quantum-inspired algorithms
- Responsible resource allocation

5. **User Control**
- Opt-out options for AI features
- Configurable suggestion levels
- Clear feedback mechanisms

## Implementation Guidelines

1. Regular audits of suggestion algorithms
2. Transparent documentation of quantum-inspired methods
3. Regular updates to improve ethical compliance
4. User feedback integration
5. Privacy-first development approach
