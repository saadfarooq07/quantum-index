# Metal Requirements and Capabilities

## Hardware Requirements

- Apple Silicon M3 or newer
- Minimum 16GB Unified Memory
- Neural Engine Support
- Metal 3 API Support

## Metal Features Used

### Core Features
- Metal Performance Shaders (MPS)
- Dynamic Graph Acceleration
- Unified Memory Architecture
- Neural Engine Integration

### Performance Optimizations
- 8-bit Quantization
- Dynamic Batching
- Memory Pool Management
- Pipeline State Objects (PSO) Caching

### Advanced Capabilities
- Real-time Graph Compilation
- Quantum Pipeline Integration
- Reality Metrics Processing
- Dynamic Resource Allocation

## Memory Management

The system requires access to:
- Minimum 4GB Unified Memory Pool
- Dynamic growth up to 16GB
- Automatic memory management
- Efficient resource deallocation

## Metal API Integration

Leverages Metal 3 features including:
- Mesh Shaders
- Function Pointers
- Argument Buffers
- Indirect Command Buffers

## Performance Targets

- 1ms latency for inference
- 95% Metal utilization
- 80% Neural Engine utilization
- Real-time graph optimization

## Compatibility Notes

While the system is optimized for M3 Pro and later:
- Fallback support for M2
- Reduced functionality on M1
- CPU fallback for non-Metal systems

## Build Requirements

Ensure the following are installed:
- Xcode 15.0+
- Metal Developer Tools
- Python 3.13.1+
- Metal Performance Shaders Support
