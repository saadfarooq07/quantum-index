# Quantum Index

A high-performance development environment optimized for Apple Silicon M3, providing intelligent process management and neural-enhanced development tools.

## Core Features

### 1. M3 Metal Optimization
- **Metal Performance Shaders**: Direct integration with M3's Neural Engine
- **Dynamic Memory Management**: Optimized for unified memory architecture
- **Adaptive Resource Allocation**: Smart memory distribution based on system pressure

### 2. Intelligent Processing
- **Parallel Processing**: Efficient handling of concurrent operations
- **Neural Analysis**: Real-time process behavior analysis using Metal-accelerated models
- **Resource Optimization**: Dynamic resource allocation based on process priorities

### 3. Performance Features
- **Metal Acceleration**: Optimized tensor operations using MPS
- **Memory Pooling**: Efficient unified memory management
- **Batch Processing**: Dynamic batch size adjustment based on memory pressure

## System Requirements

- macOS Sonoma or later
- Apple Silicon M3 Pro (or newer)
- 36GB Unified Memory (recommended)
- Xcode 15.0+ (for Metal development)

## Memory Management

The system implements careful memory management:
```python
# Example memory allocation
memory_manager = UnifiedMemoryManager(max_memory_gb=24)  # Safe allocation
optimizer = MetalMemoryOptimizer()

# Dynamic batch processing
batch_processor = M3Optimizer()
result = batch_processor.optimize_batch(tokens)
```

## Metal Performance

Leverages Metal Performance Shaders for optimal processing:
```python
# Metal tensor processing
processor = MetalTensorProcessor()
result = processor.process_tensors(input_tensors)

# Monitor system resources
config = get_metal_config()
print(f"MPS Memory Usage: {config['mps_current_allocated']} bytes")
```

## Development

1. Clone the repository:
```bash
git clone https://github.com/saadfarooq07/quantum-index.git
cd quantum-index
```

2. Create conda environment:
```bash
conda env create -f services/cortex/environment.yml
conda activate quantum-env
```

3. Set Metal environment variables:
```bash
export METAL_DEVICE_WRAPPER_TYPE=1
export PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1
```
