# Quandex Neural Engine: Your M3 Mac's AI Superpower 🚀

Hi there! Let me tell you about something really cool that makes your fancy M3 Mac even more amazing. You know how your computer has this special brain called the Neural Engine? Well, we made something that helps it think faster and smarter!

## What Makes It Special? ✨

### Speed Like Never Before 🏃‍♂️
- **Super Fast**: Uses your M3 chip's special AI powers through Metal
- **Smart Memory**: Never wastes your computer's brain power
- **Just Works**: No complicated setup needed

### Why You'll Love It 💝
- Makes LLaMA 3.2 and other AI models run FAST on your Mac
- Uses way less power than other solutions
- Perfect for developers who want to build cool AI stuff

### Perfect For... 🎯
- 🎮 Game developers using AI
- 💻 App makers who want smart features
- 🔬 Researchers who need quick results
- 🏢 Companies running AI on Macs

## Getting Started is Easy! 🌟

```python
from quandex import QuandexEngine

# That's it! Just two lines to get started
engine = QuandexEngine(model="llama-3.2")
result = await engine.process("Hello world!")
```

## Real Talk: Why It's Different 🎯

Most AI stuff needs big, expensive computers. But Quandex? It's built specially for your M3 Mac. It's like having a supercomputer, but it fits in your laptop!

### The Secret Sauce 🌟
- Uses your Mac's Neural Engine through Metal shaders
- Knows exactly how much unified memory to use
- Keeps your laptop cool and battery happy

## Quick Setup 🚀

```bash
# Install Quandex
pip install quandex

# Set up Metal optimization
export METAL_DEVICE_WRAPPER_TYPE=1
export PYTORCH_ENABLE_MPS_FALLBACK=1
```

## Features That'll Make You Smile 😊

### 1. Smart Model Loading 🧠
```python
# Load models efficiently
engine = QuandexEngine(
    model="llama-3.2",
    metal_optimize=True  # Uses M3's Neural Engine
)
```

### 2. Memory That Just Works 💫
```python
# No memory management needed!
result = await engine.process(
    "Write me a story",
    temperature=0.7
)
```

### 3. Built for Speed 🏎️
```python
# Get those stats!
stats = engine.get_metal_stats()
print(f"Processing Speed: {stats['processing_time']}ms")
```

## Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
pip install quandex
```

### Basic Usage
```python
from quandex import QuantumPipeline

# Initialize pipeline
pipeline = QuantumPipeline()

# Process input
result = pipeline.process(
    input_text="Your input here",
    reality_check=True
)
```

### Advanced Configuration
```python
from quandex.metal import MetalConfig
from quandex.quantum import QuantumConfig

# Configure Metal acceleration
metal_config = MetalConfig(
    batch_size=32,
    quantization_bits=8
)

# Configure quantum processing
quantum_config = QuantumConfig(
    reality_threshold=0.95,
    coherence_check=True
)

# Initialize optimized pipeline
pipeline = QuantumPipeline(
    metal_config=metal_config,
    quantum_config=quantum_config
)
```

## Examples

### Reality-Anchored Generation
```python
from quandex import QuantumRAG

# Initialize quantum RAG
rag = QuantumRAG()

# Process documents
docs = rag.load_documents("docs/")
rag.index_documents(docs)

# Query with reality checking
answer = rag.answer_question(
    "What is quantum computing?",
    reality_check=True
)
```

### Metal-Optimized Processing
```python
from quandex.metal import MetalAccelerator

# Initialize accelerator
accelerator = MetalAccelerator()

# Prepare model
model = accelerator.prepare_model(your_model)

# Process with Metal optimization
output = model.generate(
    input_ids=input_ids,
    metal_optimize=True
)
```
